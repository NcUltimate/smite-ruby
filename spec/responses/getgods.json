Agni, God of Fire, is the embodiment of both of these qualities, with a head for each.\\n\\nThough the source of his origin warrants debate - for there are many tales of his parentage ranging from two simple sticks rubbed together, to the cosmic energy that made all things at the beginning of time - Agni is a pivotal and important God with many duties to the Pantheon. He is the twin brother to Indra, God of the Heavens and Rains and chief among warriors. Conversely, Agni is chief among priests, acting as messenger between mortals and Gods. Every Hindu ritual and prayer is performed in front of a fire of some kind, so Agni carries the words and sacrifices, traveling between the Earth and the Heavens. He is welcome in every home and every hearth and much beloved by the Faithful.\\n\\nThrough his flames, Agni provides heat and light, but also cleanses impurities. Smoke from his pyres create the air and hold the Heavens aloft. The sun, a source of fire itself, brings life-giving energy to the world, and his lightning streaks the sky during storms.\\n\\nFor all his kindness and service, Agni has two faces. One is the face of kindness and purity, turned towards the people and Gods. His other face, grim and resolute, guides the God of Fire, to play his role in the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction, to burn and blacken all the atrocities of the world to ash.",

Isis, Osiris’ wife, secretly fled while Set plunged the kingdom into darkness. For years she toiled to reassemble her husband while his spirit form, his Ba, endured. Yet for all her searching, she could not find every part of him, and Isis was forced to reanimate Osiris without. Though not strong enough to defy Set in this incomplete form, Osiris gave Isis a son that would topple the tyrant Set and restore balance to Egypt.\\n\\nWhat remains of Osiris is a fragment of what he once was. Robbed of his crown over the earth, he now governs the realm of the dead with the same benevolence he ruled the living. But darkness looms again, and though broken, Osiris refuses to sit idly by. Mustering the last of his strength and spirit, Osiris seeks to change the course of fate, this time for the light over darkness.",

The end of times may be at hand. The final battle, Ragnarok, possibly on the horizon, for it was foretold that Loki would break free of his prison and herald the horrific final battle that would leave the Gods slain, the heavens sundered, and the world in ashes. None are more eager for that time of chaos than Loki.\\n\\nBefore his confinement, Loki’s malicious mischief managed to affect every God in ways both beneficial and terrible. Yet Loki’s most heinous act was in the death of the God of light, Baldr.\\n\\nBaldr’s prophetic dreams showcased his own death. Fearful for her son, Frigg, forced all objects of the world to swear never to harm him. All save mistletoe. Cruelly amused, Loki forged a spear from the plant and provided it to Baldr’s brother Hodr. The Gods had a new favorite game, hurling objects at Baldr and laughing as they harmlessly ricocheted. So Hodr threw the spear, but, to everyone’s horror Baldr was impaled. Hel agreed to release Baldr from the underworld if all creatures of the world mourned the God of Light.  And all did, save one crone who refused. So Baldr died.\\n\\nWhen it was discovered the crone was Loki in disguise, the furious Gods bound him in entrails and hung a venomous serpent overhead. Loki’s wife, Sigyn, collected the dripping venom in a bowl, but when she was forced to empty it, Loki was struck, causing such anguish his thrashing would shake the world.\\n\\nBut now Loki is free and already wreaking havoc.

     "Ravana's immortal reign subjugates the people. Shiva's boon grants the demon-king invulnerability against gods and beasts. Only mortal men stand a chance of defeating him, but Ravana's might is too potent for a mere man to overcome. All seems lost.\\n\\nTo save us, Vishnu took human form. Rama, prince of Ayodhya.\\n\\nAt age 16 he was already the perfect embodiment of man. Strong, humble, handsome, patient, devout; he is what mankind strives to be, yet, for all our flaws, can never reach.\\n\\nWhen a neighboring kingdom, cursed by Ravana's magic, asked for aid, Rama answered, despite the misgivings of his father. With his brother Laksharma, Rama set out and slew a horde of demons. At the palace, Rama cleansed the curse by freeing the queen from stone. The city celebrated and Rama was invited to string Shiva's bow – with the prize princess Sita's hand in marriage. Shiva's bow could not be lifted by any man, let alone strung, but Rama broke the bow in half. He and Sita wed immediately.\\n\\nReturning home, Rama was to be crown prince, but the jealousy of queen Kaikeyi forced Rama into exile, where he's remained these past fourteen years.\\n\\nYet Rama was recently seen on the field of battle. Word is, Ravana stole Rama's wife, and Rama left exile to embrace his destiny. He must defeat Ravana, free his wife, and set mankind on a path for peace, else darkness and evil will conquer all.",
